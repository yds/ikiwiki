[WMD][] is a What You See Is What You Mean editor for [[mdwn]].
This plugin makes [WMD][] be used for editing pages in the wiki.

To use the plugin, you will need to install [WMD][].
You can automagically create the required
`/usr/share/ikiwiki/wmd/wmd/* underlaydir` layout:

	cd /usr/share/ikiwiki/wmd && make

Or manually download and install the [WMD source][]:

	cd /usr/share/ikiwiki/wmd
	ftp ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/distfiles/wmd-1.0.1.zip
	unzip wmd-1.0.1.zip '*/wmd/*'
	mv wmd-1.0.1/wmd wmd
	rm -rf wmd-1.0.1*

Either way you should now have a `/usr/share/ikiwiki/wmd/wmd/wmd.js` file
as well as some other files and an images directory in the same place.

Note that the [WMD][] plugin does **not** handle [[ikiwiki]] [[directive]]s.
For this reason the normal `preview` button remains.
